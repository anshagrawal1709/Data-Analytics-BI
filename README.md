# Data-Analytics-BI
The following repository contains all my projects with respect to Data Analytics/ BI till date

My Overview

I am a pre-final year undergraduate student currently pursuing Mathematics and Computing at Delhi Technological University (Formerly Delhi College of Engineering).  
Currently, I am working on Data Analytics and Business Intelligence projects using MySql, Tableau, MS Excel, and Python.
In the past, I have also worked on machine learning and deep learning projects.

I am working in consulting small age startups and building sustainable businesses with the help of a couple of internationally recognized student-run organizations, namely, 180 Degrees Consulting and Enactus (Entrepreneurial Action Us). 
Apart from the above, I have been involved in various Leadership roles and project/ event managerial roles at the school and university level and also have earned the Google Ads Search and Measurement Certification along with the Enterprise Design Thinking Practitioner Badge by IBM.

Data Analytics/ Business Intelligence Journey

I started my journey with an Internship as a Data Analyst at Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC), Kuwait in the summer of 2019.
Due to the contract with the organization, I am not allowed to share any documents with anyone outside the organization.

However, the work performed during the Internship was as follows :

Performed data analysis and developed a path for cables and spotted the free routes using MS Excel
Spotted major faults in the cable layout and created new routes using the free routes available through various intermediates
Customized a more refined pathway reducing material usage and distance

In the winter of 2019, I was interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning and hence started learning.
You can refer the source code for 2 projects in Machine Learning at Twitter tweet Disaster prediction and House Prices Sales prediction

In March 2020, I found that I was very interested in the field of Business Intelligence and data analytics and hence started learning about the industry. I learned Tableau, MySql, and advanced MS Excel.

My first data analysis project was a MySql querying project. I picked up a dummy database with 8 tables and queried the data. You can access the document with the code along with the output at MySql Project

My second project was developing a dashboard on Tableau using the Superstore samples sales dataset.
The dashboard takes into account the states, categories, subcategories, profit, sales, and mode of delivery; and effectively provides an insight into how the parameters vary and correlate. You can access the tableau dashboard at Tableau Project

The real-life project that I am working on right now is in a community named Mentorskool. The project aims to provide a detailed insight into the schools of Karnataka regarding the various facilities.

Below listed are the areas I have worked upon in the project till date:
Building an extensive Issue Tree to get to the root cause of the problem “Why are schools in India ineffective and inefficient?”. You can access the Issue tree at Issue Tree
Scraping data from a government website
Basic data exploration, developing important parameters from existing ones and filling of null values
Various statistical tests such as T-test, ANOVA, Z-test, Chi-square. You can access the statistical tests along with the dataset at 

Future plans for the project
Detailed visual analysis and insights using Python, Tableau and MySql
Developing a dashboard along with a storyline on Tableau
Creating a weighted ranking system for all the schools present taking into account some of the most important parameters.
